<center><h3>COMPARATIVE INDOEUROPEAN DATA CORPUS,<br>
COLLECTED BY ISIDORE DYEN</h3></center>

<p>
This is one of three hypertext pages introducing a data corpus consisting
of lexicostatistical data on 95 Indo-European languages prepared by Prof.
Isidore Dyen of Yale University before 1970, together with some derived
data.  This data corpus is the basis for some<a href="PUBLICATIONS.html">
publications,</a> which are described in a second page.  To put the
data and these publications in context, a third page presents a brief
history and <a href="BIBLIOG.html">bibliography</a> of comparative
lexicostatistics.

<p>
The data corpus presented here consists of several files, described briefly
below.  

Each file consists of a text prologue followed by the data, and is
a text file, i.e., a plain ascii file.

The prologue of each file provides much more detailed information than that
given below.  The prologue of the first file, IE-DATA1, is particularly
important, and contains information necessary for a full understanding of
all the other files.

The groups of file descriptions are arranged in a natural order:  the files
in each group depend on data from file(s) in some previous group but do not
depend on data from files in subsequent groups.  Just by chance, the files
are also in alphabetical order.

<p>
The files are accessible both by ftp, and directly from this file by clicking
on the titles of the files (in two different places).

<h3><a href="./IE-DATA1">File IE-DATA1</a></h3>

<p>
This file contains data that was placed on punched cards circa 1970,
and transferred to disc circa 1990.  It gives cognation data among 95
Indoeuropean speech varieties.  For each meaning in the list of 200
basic meanings (chosen by Morris Swadesh in 1952), this file contains

<blockquote>the forms used in the 95 speech varieties</blockquote>

collected by Isidore Dyen and

<blockquote>the cognation decisions among these forms</blockquote>

made by Isidore Dyen circa 1970.  Note, however, that the speech
forms are represented only as upper case English letters that were
punched long ago into IBM cards, and do NOT contain the diacritical
marks that were handwritten onto the surface of the cards.  Thus the
cognation decisions are provided in full detail, and the forms are
described well enough for an expert to check <i>which</i> forms were chosen,
BUT ...

<blockquote>THE FORMS ARE NOT DESCRIBED WELL ENOUGH FOR PHONOLOGICAL OR
        PHONETIC USE!</blockquote>

We hope to provide the forms in fuller detail in 1996.

<p>
The
<a href="PUBLICATIONS.html">monograph</a> uses only 84 of the 95 speech
varieties.  For a list of the speech varieties not used, see the end of the
prologue.  For an explanation of why they were omitted, see both the
prologue and the footnote on page 19 of the monograph.

<h3><a href="./IE-PERC84">File IE-PERC84</a></h3>
<h3><a href="./IE-PERC95">File IE-PERC95</a></h3>

<p>
These files contain an 84x84 and a 95x95 matrix respectively.  The 84x84
matrix is the same as the matrix printed in Appendix A5 of the
<a href="PUBLICATIONS.html">monograph</a>.

<p>
Each value in the matrices is the "percentage cognate", based on the data
in IE-DATA1, between the homosemantic forms for a pair of speech
varieties.  Each matrix is symmetric, and both halves are provided even
though they contain the same values.  The values on the main diagonal of
each matrix are arbitrarily given as 0.

<h3><a href="./IE-RATE1">File IE-RATE1</a></h3>

<p>
This file contains substitution rates for each of the 200 Swadesh meanings in
Indoeuropean, based on the data from IE-DATA1.  The method used and numerous
other results can be found in <a href="PUBLICATIONS.html">Kruskal 1973</a>

<p>
The "substitution rate (for a meaning in a language family)" is the average
number of occasions (per unit time) on which a new word displaces an old
one as the normal way of expressing that meaning.  Most prior applications
of glottochronology have assumed that the substitution  rate is the same
for all meanings in the Swadesh list, despite
<a href=BIBLIOG.html#EqSubRate>a series of papers</a> by different authors
pointing out the inadequacy of this assumption.  The paper just cited,
Kruskal (1973), explicitly estimates the substitution rate for each meaning
in a Swadesh list for each of three language families, and also makes use
of previously estimated substitution rates for 5 groups of meanings for the
Austronesian family.

<p>
The paper just cited illustrates the use of substitution rates to
estimate time separations among the speech varieties, and presents graphs
to contrast the time separations estimated using individual substitution
rates with time separations that would have been yielded by the classical
"single substitution rate" assumption.

<h3><a href="./IE-TIME84">File IE-TIME84</a></h3>
<h3><a href="./IE-TIME95">File IE-TIME95</a></h3>

<p>
These files contain an 84x84 and a 95x95 matrix respectively.  The value in
row <i>i</i> and column <i>j</i> of each matrix is the separation time
between speech varieties <i>i</i> and <i>j</i>, estimated using the
substitution rates from file IE-RATE1 and the cognations from file IE-DATA1.

<h3>SOME PRACTICAL DETAILS</h3>

<p>
All the data files are in "text" format, i.e., they are plain ascii files.
Here are the (uncompressed) sizes of the files.
