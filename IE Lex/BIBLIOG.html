<h1>Comparative Lexicostatistics:</h1>
<h2>A Brief History and Bibliography of Key Works</h2>
<hr>

<p>
<strong>Comparative lexicostatistics</strong> refers to ways of developing
hypotheses about the historical relations among speech varieties through a
quantitative study of cognation among their vocabularies.  It is only
legitimate to apply this among speech varieties already known to belong to
the same language family, since without this prior determination there can
be no assurance of cognation.  The word "comparative" is frequently
dropped, and "lexicostatistics" used for this meaning, as we do in the
following discussion, even though this usage opens the possibility of
confusion with other kinds of statistical study of vocabulary.

<p>
In the broad meaning given above, lexicostatistics includes the estimation
of times at which language splits have occurred based on comparative
lexical information, a technique often referred to as glottochronology.
However, in a narrower meaning always insisted on by Isidore Dyen and
others, lexicostatistics strictly <em>excludes</em> glottochronology.  In
practice, lexicostatistics almost always refers to the reconstruction of
language trees by use of lexicostatistical percentages, and this is how we
use it below.  The distinction between lexicostatistics and
glottochronology is important, because the latter depends far more
sensitively on simplifying assumptions (see <a href="#EqSubRate">below</a>)
than the former.

<p>
The oldest and most widely-used lexicostatistical approach uses the
"lexicostatistical percentage" to estimate the degree of relationship
between two speech varieties (in the same language family):  the higher the
percentage, the more recent their divergence from a common ancestor and
thus the closer their historical relationship.  The lexicostatistical
percentage is based on some list of "basic meanings", such as the list of
200 meanings selected in <a href="#Sw52">Swadesh 1952</a>, and refers to
the percentage of the basic meanings for which words in the two varieties
are cognate.  With extreme brevity, this may be summarized as the
<em>percentage of homosemantic cognation among the basic vocabulary</em>.
Some other equally simple measures of relationship have been proposed and
even tried but have demonstrable defects.  One such measure is like the one
above but without the homosemantic restriction.  Dropping the restriction
greatly increases the chance of false cognation judgments due to chance
similarity of forms.

<p>
Although the notion of lexicostatistics is old (<a href="#Hy73">Hymes
1973 </a>, <a href="#We73">Wells 1973</a>), modern studies tend to go back to
the work of <a href="#Sw50">Swadesh (1950, 1952, 1955)</a> and
<a href="#Le53">Lees (1953)</a>.

<p>
General introductions to the approach have been written in English by
<a href="#Gu56">Gudschinsky (1956) </a>,
<a href="#Hy60">Hymes (1960) </a>, <a href="#Em86">Embleton (1986)</a>,
and in other languages by <a href="#Ti73">Tischler (1973)</a> and
<a href="#Ya76">Yasumoto and Nozaki (1976)</a>.
Collections of papers include <a href="#Dy73a">Dyen (1973a and 1975)</a> and
<a href="#Dy&76">Dyen and Jucquois (1976)</a>.
For the potential impact of lexicostatistics on comparative linguistics see
<a href="#Dy73b">Dyen (1973b, 1976)</a>.

<p>
Early in its history lexicostatistics was plagued by questions of its
validity:
e.g. <a href="#Be58">Bergsland (1958) </a>, <a href="#Be62">Bergsland and
Vogt (1962) </a>, <a href="#Fo61">Fodor (1961) </a>,
<a href="#Ch62">Chr&eacute;tien (1962)</a>, and <a href="#Gu80">Guy (1980)</a>.
These questions arose from several sources:
(i) misunderstandings about the mathematical nature of the procedures,
(ii) confusion between lexicostatistics and glottochronology, and
(iii) consfusion between glottochronology in general and particular methods
of doing it.
Concerns (i) and (ii) have been addressed by <a href="#Do72">Dobson,
Kruskal, Sankoff and Savage (1972)</a>, and by <a href="#Dy73c">
Dyen (1973c)</a>, while (iii) has been addressed by
<a href="#Kr73">Kruskal, Dyen, and Black 1973</a>.

<p>
One question that has often arisen is based on a simplifying assumption that
is implicit in lexicostatistics as described above, and
has frequently been used in glottochronology.  According to this
simplification, different meanings are subject to the<a name="EqSubRate">
<em>same rate of substitution</em>, i.e., the word used for one meaning is
just as likely to change as the word for another meaning.
This matter has been explored thoroughly by <a href="#va66">van der Merwe
(1966) </a>, <a href="#Dy&67">Dyen, James and Cole (1967) </a>, <a
href="#Sa69">Sankoff (1969, 1970, 1973) </a>, <a href="#Kr71">Kruskal, Dyen and
Black (1971, 1973)</a>, and <a href="#Ar72">Arapov and Kherts (1972)</a>.
The effect of this simplifying assumption are quite different for
lexicostatistics and for glottochronology.
For lexicostatistics, as explained most fully in <a href="#Sa73">
Sankoff 1973</a>), many improvements in realism of the model are
feasible and have been tried, at the cost of
additional mathematical and computational complexity, but the approach
described above provides a remarkably good approximation.
For glottochronology, as explained most fully in
<a href="#Kr73">Kruskal, Dyen, and Black 1973</a>, this simplifying
assumption seriously distorts the time estimates, but more realistic models
can be and have been applied.

<p>
Other problems that have been addressed by comparative lexicostatistics include:
<ul>
<li> the nature and methodology of linguistic classification (<a href="#Dy62">Dyen 1962 </a>, <a href="#Do69a">Dobson 1969a, 1969b</a>), including
the use of multidimensional scaling to investigate non-hierarchical relationships (<a href="#Bl76">Black 1976 </a>, <a href="#Do79">Dobson and Black
1979</a>), and
<li> the effects of unusually heavy borrowing and of word taboo phenomena
(<a href="#Dy63">Dyen 1963</a> and <a href="#Blf">Black forthcoming</a>)
</ul>
The validity and usefulness of lexicostatistical approaches have been tested
through both computer simulation (<a href="#Sa69">Sankoff 1969 </a>,
<a href="#Em86">Embleton 1986</a>) and through application to such language
families as Austronesian <a href="#Dy65">Dyen 1965</a>) and Indoeuropean
(<a href="#Dy92">Dyen, Kruskal and Black 1992</a>), i.e.  the
<a href="PUBLICATIONS.html">monograph</a>.
The latter work found that lexicostatistics, applied to the data in the
present data corpus, produced results that compare favorably with those
obtained through a more than a century of qualitative linguistics research
on the Indoeuropean languages.
