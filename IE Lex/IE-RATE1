DESCRIPTION OF THE DATA--------------------------This file contains substitution rates for each of the 200 Swadesh meanings inIndoeuropean, based on the data from IE-DATA1.  The time unit, which can notbe estimated from our own data, is crudely estimated from a very small dataset published by Lees in 1953 to be roughly 2400 years.The "substitution rate (for a meaning in a language family)" is the averagenumber of occasions (per time unit) on which a new word displaces an old oneas the normal way of expressing that meaning.  Virtually all prior applicationsof glottochronology has assumed that this rate is the same for all meanings inthe Swadesh list, despite a series of papers by different authors pointingout the inadequacy of this assumption.  The paper cited aboveexplicitly estimates the substitution rate for each meaning in a Swadeshlist for each of three families: Indoeuropean(95), Cushitic(63), andPhilippine(107).  (The number following each family name indicates the numberof speech varieties in the data.)  The paper also makes use of previouslyestimated substitution rates for 5 groups of meanings for Austronesian(371),which shares 40 speech varieties with the Philippine family.The Indoeuropean rates are based on the data in file IE-DATA1.  The paperjust cited also illustrates the use of substitution rates to estimate timeseparations among the speech varieties, and presents graphs to contrast thetime separations for Indoeuropean and Austronesian with time separationsthat would have been yielded by the classical assumption that "allsubstitution rates are equal".-----------3.
